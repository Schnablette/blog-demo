# Blog Demo for Metaintro

I'm building this demo out while I create my own blog site. Follow along in the videos on youtube. Branches are separated into sessions.

You can pull down and run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
